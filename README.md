# cpu_raytracer

This is a fairly simple ray tracer written in c++.
It is written completely from scratch and includes the implementation of .bmp file format, but you can remake it to work with formats you like.
The .bmp format is used because of its simplicity.

The ray tracer itself has the implementation of only spheres, basic lightning and shading.
